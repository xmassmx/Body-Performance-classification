# Body Performance Classification

Hi, 

This repository contains my work for the final project of the EEE - 485: Statistical Learning and Data Analytics course at Bilkent University.

In  our  project,  we  aim  to  classify  the  body  performance  of  people  into  four  classes, given   certain   physical   features. 
The   classification   algorithms   we   employ   are   K   Nearest Neighbors  (KNN),  Na√Øve  Bayes,  and  Feedforward Neural  Networks. 
We  experiment  with  different  hyper-parameters  and  architectures  in  order  to  maximize  the  classification  accuracy. 
We  also  use dimensionality  reduction  techniques  such  as  Principal  Component Analysis  to  understand  their effects on our results.
